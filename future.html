    <p>I loved being a cook. It was really satisfying to be able to create something with your hands and be able to point at it at the end of the day and say, "I created that. Those 120# of sausage, I made that out of pork shoulders". But I was never really using my brain and I like thinking through logic puzzles! So I decided to change careers and this is that first step. Additionally I'm almost 30 and want to start saving for the future so this seemed like a better decision than staying in the culinary field, especially given that I want to live in the absurdly expensive Seattle area.</p>

      <p>My dream would be do design games in some way. Maybe it would be making a map for a new level for an RTS campaign or designing AI for an NPC or creating a new board game. I want to work in games for sure, they are what fascinate me. They're that thing which I find myself thinking about just because it's interesting rather than because I'm choosing to.<p>
      <p>But I'd be exstatic to simply find myself working at a company using HTML or CSS (and hopefully Javascript) to manage a website in two years too. I am very excited to spend time at work using my brain sometime soon.</p>
      <p>To understand how excited I am just watch Ellaine from Seinfeld dance! I'm a bad dancer but I share her enthusiasm.</p>
