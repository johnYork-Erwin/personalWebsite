      <h2>Bridge: the ultimate standard card game.</h2>
        <p>Bridge is, in my opinion, far and away the most complex and interesting card game. It is exclusively played with four players and you are teammates with the person across the table from you. All 52 cards are dealt each hand consists of two parts: the bidding and the play of hand.</p>
        <p>It begins with a round of bidding that does not end until three consecutive players have 'passed'. The bidding determines which suit will be trump and requires partners to express their hands to one another using a mutually agreed upon foreign language to convey general strength and suit distributions. Only higher bids may be legally bid, if one team says they will take 7 of 13 tricks with spades as trump, the next person may only make a bid which claims 8 or more tricks given their choice of trump. Thus, whichever team is willing to accept a higher risk will be able to determine the trump suit.<p>
        <p>From the bidding a contract is reached and the team that did not determine the trump suit becomes 'defence' for that hand. They choose the first lead and, following that lead, one persons hand is revealed, that player will sit out having their partner make all decisions for them. The defence then tries to prevent their opponents from reaching or exceeding their contract which will be some number of the total tricks given the trump suit they chose.</p>
        <p>The amazing thing about this game is that it combines a language puzzle (how to express your hand to your partner) and a logic puzzle (how to play the hand to garner the most tricks). Furthermore, the fact that one of the four players' hands is revealed means that every active player knows where exactly half the cards are but they all know different halves; each player knows their own hand and the hand revealed.</p>
        <p>Bridge is a dieing game, it was incredibly popular but has fallen from grace. I hope you'll give it a try, we need more young players. It really is vastly more interesting to me than any other game I've played. <a href ="http://www.acbl.org/">Check it out here.</a></p>
